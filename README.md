## Hi, I am Markus 👋🏼
🎓 I am studying technische Informatik at OTH Regensburg.

🛠️ My main focus is embedded programming using C/C++ and FPGA design with VHDL.

🔭 I’m currently working on different projects using Microchip microcontrollers as well as projects using the Digilent Cmod A7 35T FPGA and Vivado.

🌱 I’m currently learning about:
- Build tools like Make and CMake
- Different low level protocols like UART, SPI, I2C, etc.
- Using C/C++ optimized for embedded systems.
- Building more complex VHDL systems
- Designing printed circuit boards and soldering them, working with both 0603 SMD and THT components
